### Background

Right out of high school, I started a blog. It didn't last long, and like most blogs, dried up like a mining town. Web crawlers were the principal traffic. This week I reflected on what I wrote for the first time in a few years. It's strange to see how much has changed, and as strange to see how much hasn't.

Present in that blog were a shocking number of references to [Master Oogway](http://kungfupanda.wikia.com/wiki/Oogway), including this especially disturbing passage: 

> Drop by drop, pain which could not forget fell upon my heart, but in the throes if my despair, I found wisdom. 
> Master Oogway had come to me, in his turtle form, and delivered his timeless truths. I ate from the juicy mango of his knowledge until it was only a pit that remained in my shriveled and dripping hands.

I honestly don't remember myself being *that* weird, but there it is. I definitely had an apter knowledge of CGI turtles, and probably knew more ActionScript back then.

### More relevant

I'm rambling slightly, but I thought I'd situate this blog in the context of its predecessor. Since then I've gone to a few different colleges, had a few different jobs. I like to think I've learned a few things. I'm now deposited in a room in West Philadelphia, a few brick avenues from the Schuylkill.

The point of this site: I have opinions, on tech and otherwise, and like to share them in some cases. Let this blog then handle those cases.
