Google decided it would be a sound decision to pick me up as an intern on their Cloud team, and so here I'll be for the next three months! The work is interesting, as is this strange, far-flung state. 

Being kicked like a pinecone across the country has been quite an experience. From the Ohio River, to Lake Michigan, to the Schuylkill, and now off to the Pacific. Another new home... another state... and all the confusion, disorientation, and excitement that come with.
