![Mountain View]({{ "/assets/images/mountain-view.jpg" | absolute_url }})

Google decided it would be a good idea to pick me up as an intern on their Cloud team, and so here I'll be for the next three months. This position is what I'd worked toward for the past few years, but I'm not without apprehension. I've never felt at ease sleeping with my back to mountains, yet here I am, in Mountain View, California, and the bastards have me on all sides. 

Being kicked like a pinecone across the country, I feel curiously out of control. From the Ohio River, to Lake Michigan, to the Schuylkill, and now off to the Pacific. Another new home... another state... and all the confusion, disorientation, and excitement that come with. This apprehension is hard to explain, but, I think, must be closer to happiness than anything else, for which I am grateful.
