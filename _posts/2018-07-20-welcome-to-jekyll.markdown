### The backstory

Right out of high school, I started a blog. It didn't last long, and like most blogs, dried up like a mining town. Web crawlers were the principal traffic. This week I reflected on what I wrote for the first time in a few years. It's strange to see how much has changed, and as strange to see how much hasn't.

It was a troubled time for me. I'll use what I wrote a few years ago to illustrate:

> In the last three months, I have been rejected from seven colleges. One after the other. 
> The thin envelopes came, and they came, and they didn’t stop coming. 
> “We regret to inform you” by “we regret to inform you”, I was eaten away. I was in a daze.

Also present in that blog were a shocking number of references to [Master Oogway](http://kungfupanda.wikia.com/wiki/Oogway), including this especially disturbing passage: 

> Drop by drop, pain which could not forget fell upon my heart, but in the throes if my despair, I found wisdom. 
> Master Oogway had come to me, in his turtle form, and delivered his timeless truths. I ate from the juicy mango of his knowledge until it was only a pit that remained in my shriveled and dripping hands.

As I'm sure is clear, I had bizarre ideas about what going to college meant. I had bizarre ideas about what programming meant. I had an apter knowledge of CGI turtles.

### More relevant

I'm rambling, but I thought I'd situate this blog in the context of its predecessor. Since then I've gone to a few different colleges, made a few different friends, had a few different jobs. I like to think I've learned a few things. I'm now deposited in a room in West Philadelphia, a few brick avenues from the Schuylkill.

In front of me is a window, across which forms a scene that more resembles Amman than Philly. Trees with low, welcoming branches. A fence below, scarcely lit. 

The point of this blog? Not so clear. But I have opinions, on tech and otherwise, and like to share them in some cases. Let this blog then handle those cases.
