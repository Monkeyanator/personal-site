![Me]({{ "/assets/images/ocean_glow.jpg" | absolute_url }})

My name is Sam, and I like working on hard problems. The two hardest problems I've come across are those of making people communciate and making computers communicate.

Over Fall 2018, I was a Software Engineering Intern at Google. I worked on the Kubernetes Node Team, where [I introduced a distributed tracing model](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/650) into open-source Kubernetes. As part of this work, I also [wrote a mutating admission webhook](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/mutating-trace-admission-controller) which injects a trace context annotation into objectsg, and which was adopted as an official sig-instrumentation project.

Over Summer 2018, I was a Software Engineering Intern at [Amino Payments](https://www.aminopay.com/). I used [Apache Samza](http://samza.apache.org/) to process high-throughput advertisement transaction streams, as well as other backend-related tasks.

I study Computer Science at [Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/eecs/computer-science/), where I do research into [On-the-Go Crowdsourcing](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~ykt413/papers/otg.pdf) with the [Design, Technology, and Research Lab](http://dtr.northwestern.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Haoqi Zhang](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~hq/) and [Yongsung Kim](http://yongsungkim.com/). 

Before that, I worked at the [Knowledge Discovery and Web Mining Lab](http://webmining.spd.louisville.edu/) and researched recommendation engines under [Dr. Olfa Nasraoui](http://louisville.edu/speed/people/faculty/nasraouiOlfa) at the University of Louisville [under this research grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1549981).

Even further back, I worked on the site [The Glass Capitol](https://glasscapitol.org/). I contributed to our [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) backend, but dabbled in data visualization and other front-end miscellany as well.

I will be starting as a Software Engineering Intern at [Belvedere Trading](http://www.belvederetrading.com/) in January, 2019.
