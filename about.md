![Me]({{ "/assets/images/hq_headshot.jpg" | absolute_url }})

My name is Sam Naser, and right now, I'm a Software Engineering Intern at Google. I work on the Google Cloud Services team, improving the tracing support for [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/).

Over Summer 2018, I was a Software Engineering Intern at [Amino Payments](https://www.aminopay.com/). I used [Apache Samza](http://samza.apache.org/) to process high-throughput advertisement transaction streams, as well as other backend-related tasks.

I study Computer Science at [Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/eecs/computer-science/), where I do research into [On-the-Go Crowdsourcing](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~ykt413/papers/otg.pdf) with the [Design, Technology, and Research Lab](http://dtr.northwestern.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Haoqi Zhang](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~hq/) and [Yongsung Kim](http://yongsungkim.com/). 

Before that, I worked at the [Knowledge Discovery and Web Mining Lab](http://webmining.spd.louisville.edu/) and researched recommendation engines under [Dr. Olfa Nasraoui](http://louisville.edu/speed/people/faculty/nasraouiOlfa) (honking cool contraptions!) at the University of Louisville [under this research grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1549981).

Even further back, I worked on the site [The Glass Capitol](https://glasscapitol.org/). I contributed to our [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) backend, but dabbled in data visualization and other front-end miscellany as well.

I will be starting as a Software Engineering Intern at [Belvedere Trading](http://www.belvederetrading.com/) in January, 2019.
