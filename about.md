![Me]({{ "/assets/images/sunset.jpg" | absolute_url }})

My name is Sam, and I like working on hard problems. Computers pose some interesting ones, and solve a few others, but really there are hard problems everywhere.

I worked twice at Google as a Software Engineering Intern (miraculously on open-source both times), once on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), where I [made this](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/mutating-trace-admission-controller) and [wrote this](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/650), and then on [Istio](https://istio.io), where [I did](https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/15503) [some](https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/15941) [useful](https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/15418) [stuff](https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/15297). I also worked as an intern on trading technologies at [Belvedere Trading](http://www.belvederetrading.com/) and ad tech at [Amino Payments](https://www.aminopay.com/).

I study Computer Science at [Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/eecs/computer-science/). I did research into [On-the-Go Crowdsourcing](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~ykt413/papers/otg.pdf) with the [DTR Lab](http://dtr.northwestern.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Haoqi Zhang](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~hq/) and [Yongsung Kim](http://yongsungkim.com/).

Before that, I worked at the [Knowledge Discovery and Web Mining Lab](http://webmining.spd.louisville.edu/) and researched recommendation engines under [Dr. Olfa Nasraoui](http://louisville.edu/speed/people/faculty/nasraouiOlfa) at the University of Louisville [under this research grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1549981).

I'll skip the part where I list my hobbies, seems tacky ðŸ™„
